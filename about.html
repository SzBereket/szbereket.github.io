          <p>Hi to everyone who visited my website!<br><br>My name is Sabri Bereket and I was born in İzmir(TR), I live in Şanlıurfa(TR). I am an Electrical-Electronics engineering student, Data analyst, Data scientist, Desktop developer and also creative coder.<br><br>I would refer to myself as a multi-disciplinary programmer dealing with many things like electrical, electronics, microprocessors, project management, data analyst, data engineer, creative coding.<br><br>My journey with software started at the age of 12 by downloading visual studio to the old computer of the company, as I was drawn to games at the company where my mother worked, and I started making stupid childish desktop applications using Visual Basic. After the university exam, I chose the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I wanted my career to progress with software. I've looked at most of the software types. I focused on developing the subjects of data analysis, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, which I would be happy and enthusiastically do with maximum efficiency. <br> <br> I am studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Harran University, Faculty of Engineering. I will get my Bachelor's degree in 2023. While I was studying at my university, I was entitled to the Erasmus+ program and between 2021-2022 I studied at Lublin University of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineer & Computer Science in Poland. Although I could not be very active due to the pandemic, I became interested in many software languages and created projects about them. I am currently working actively for a school project on Data science & AI.
